# Industry level knowledge graph challenges

**Entity disambiguation and managing identity**

Many entities extracted automatically have very similar surface forms, such as people with the same or similar names, or movies, songs and books with similar titles. Two products with different name might refer to different listings. Without correct linking and disambiguation, entities will be incorrectly associated with wrong facts and resulting in incorrect inference downstream. 

**Type membership and resolution**

**Managing changing knowledge**

**Knowledge extraction from multiple structured and unstructured sources**

**Managing operations at scale**

**Knowledge graph semantic embedding**

**Knowldege graph inference and verification**

**Federation of global, domain-specific, and customer-specific knowledge**

**Securty and privacy for personalised, on-device knowldege graphs**

**Multilingual knowledge systems**
